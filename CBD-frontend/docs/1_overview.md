# Introduction & Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to CBD3 (Colorectal Cancer Biomarker Database v3), a comprehensive platform designed to accelerate colorectal cancer research through integrated analysis of biomarkers, clinical data, and single-cell RNA sequencing data.

Our platform provides researchers with powerful tools to:

- Includes colorectal cancer biomarkers curated from selected medical literature and manually validated
- Visualize and explore single-cell RNA sequencing data
- Investigate protein-protein interaction networks
- Access curated clinical trial data and patient outcomes
- Perform advanced searches across multiple data types

## Quick Start

1. **Explore Biomarkers**: Browse our comprehensive collection of colorectal cancer biomarkers
2. **Analyze Data**: Use our interactive tools to explore protein-protein interaction networks and single-cell atlas
3. **Visualize Results**: Create custom visualizations of your research findings
4. **Export Data**: Download results in various formats for further analysis

## Data Sources

Our database integrates data from multiple authoritative sources:

- **PubMed Literature**: Curated biomarker data from scientific literature
- **TCGA**: Clinical validation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
- **GEO**: Single-cell RNA sequencing data from Gene Expression Omnibus
- **STRING**: Protein-protein interaction networks from STRING database

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue 3, Pinia, Element Plus
- **Backend**: Express.js, MySQL
- **Visualization**: Echarts, Cytoscape.js
