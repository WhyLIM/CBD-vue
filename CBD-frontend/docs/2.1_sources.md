# Data Sources

CBD3 integrates data from multiple authoritative sources to provide a comprehensive resource for colorectal cancer biomarker research.

## Primary Data Sources

### 1. PubMed Literature Data

Our biomarker database is primarily built from PubMed literature through:

- **Automated Collection**: Systematic mining of PubMed abstracts and full-text articles related to colorectal cancer biomarkers
- **Manual Verification**: Expert review of extracted biomarkers to ensure clinical relevance and accuracy
- **Regular Updates**: Yearly updates incorporating the latest published research (In fact, we are trying to automate the process to speed up the update frequency)

**Data Includes**:
