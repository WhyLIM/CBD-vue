# Data Limitations

While we strive for comprehensive coverage and high quality, users should be aware of certain limitations in our data.

## Scope Limitations

- **Disease Focus**: Currently limited to colorectal cancer biomarkers only
- **Publication Bias**: Published biomarkers may not represent all potential biomarkers
- **Temporal Bias**: Recent discoveries may not yet be included in our database
- **Population Bias**: Most clinical data is from specific geographic regions
- **Language Bias**: Primarily English-language publications are processed

## Data Source Constraints

### Literature Data
- **Publication Lag**: Time between discovery and publication can be significant
- **Positive Results Bias**: Tendency to publish positive rather than negative results
- **Access Limitations**: Some relevant publications may be behind paywalls

### Clinical Data (TCGA)
- **Population Specificity**: Primarily from North American populations
- **Treatment Era**: May not reflect current treatment standards
- **Sample Selection**: Potential bias in patient selection for studies

### Single-Cell Data (GEO)
- **Technical Variability**: Different platforms have varying capabilities
- **Processing Differences**: Various preprocessing methods affect comparability
- **Annotation Challenges**: Subjectivity in cell type classification

### Protein Networks (STRING)
- **Prediction-Based Interactions**: Some interactions are predicted rather than experimentally validated
- **Context Specificity**: Interactions may not occur in all biological contexts
- **Species Differences**: Some interactions based on non-human studies

## Technical Limitations

- **Detection Method Variability**: Different studies may use different detection methods
- **Measurement Standardization**: Lack of universal standards for biomarker measurement
- **Sample Size Limitations**: Some studies have small sample sizes affecting statistical power
- **Multiple Testing Issues**: Risk of false positives in large-scale analyses
- **Data Integration Challenges**: Difficulties in mapping identifiers across databases

## Clinical Applicability Constraints

- **Ethnic Diversity**: Limited representation of diverse ethnic groups
- **Age Distribution**: Underrepresentation of certain age groups
- **Stage Specificity**: Some biomarkers only validated for specific cancer stages
- **Comorbidity Exclusions**: Patients with comorbidities often excluded from studies
- **Cost-Effectiveness Data**: Limited information on cost-benefit analyses

## Mitigation Strategies

- **Regular Updates**: Frequent updates to address temporal biases
- **Source Diversification**: Incorporating diverse data sources
- **Quality Flags**: Clear indicators of data quality issues
- **Confidence Scores**: Quantitative measures of confidence in data points
- **Clear Documentation**: Explicit documentation of known limitations

## Future Improvements

- **Expanded Data Sources**: Incorporating more diverse and international data
- **Improved Standardization**: Better methods for data harmonization
- **Enhanced Validation**: More rigorous validation procedures
- **User Guidance**: Guidelines for appropriate data interpretation

## User Responsibility

- **Critical Evaluation**: Users should understand applicable limitations
- **Appropriate Application**: Using data within its validated scope
- **Independent Validation**: Verifying findings through independent means
- **Acknowledging Limitations**: Properly acknowledging limitations in publications
