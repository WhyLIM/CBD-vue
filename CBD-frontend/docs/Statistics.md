# ðŸ“Š Statistics

This page provides a statistical overview of the data contained in the Cancer Biomarker Database (CBD). The charts and figures presented here are generated dynamically based on the current data in our system.

## ðŸ“ˆ Database Overview

This section provides a real-time summary of the contents of our database.

- **Total Biomarkers**: The total number of unique biomarkers cataloged.
- **Total Cancer Types**: The number of distinct cancer types represented.
- **Total Publications**: The number of scientific publications referenced.

*Note: These numbers are updated automatically as new data is added to the CBD.*

## Cancer Type Distribution

The following chart illustrates the distribution of biomarkers across different cancer types. This helps to visualize which cancer types are most represented in our database.

*(A dynamic pie chart or bar chart showing the breakdown of biomarkers by cancer type will be displayed here.)*

## Biomarker Type Distribution

This chart shows the functional classification of the biomarkers in our database.

- **Diagnostic**: Biomarkers used for detecting cancer.
- **Prognostic**: Biomarkers that predict the likely outcome of the disease.
- **Predictive**: Biomarkers that predict the response to a particular treatment.
